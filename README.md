# Secure Coding for Java

This repository contains the demos and exercises for the *Secure Coding in Java* course developed by Robert C. Seacord.

Because this repostory contains demos and exercises for a secure coding course, many of the examples contain vulnerabilities and other nasty defects that you don't want to deploy in your system.
Consequently, we've left the message from Github that "We found potential security vulnerabilities in your dependencies" as a warning to others to be careful about incorporating these examples into your systems.  
This code is mean for expository purposes only.
